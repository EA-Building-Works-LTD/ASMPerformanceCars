  {
    id: 'mod-1',
    question: 'How do vehicle modifications affect my insurance?',
    answer: 'Vehicle modifications typically affect insurance premiums because they can change the risk profile of your car. Performance modifications like engine tuning or turbocharging may increase premiums significantly as they enhance the vehicle\'s power and speed capability. Aesthetic modifications such as body kits and custom paint might have less impact. Always declare all modifications to your insurer to ensure your policy remains valid. Some specialist insurers cater specifically to modified vehicles and may offer more competitive rates than mainstream providers.',
  },
  {
    id: 'mod-2',
    question: 'Which car modifications are legal in the UK?',
    answer: 'In the UK, many modifications are legal provided they comply with safety and environmental regulations. All modifications must be declared to your insurer and noted on your vehicle\'s registration document (V5C). Legal modifications typically include aftermarket wheels (within certain specifications), suspension enhancements, ECU remapping, and aesthetic changes like body kits. However, excessively tinted windows (front must allow 70% light transmission), certain lighting alterations, and modifications affecting emissions may be illegal. Always check current regulations before modifying your vehicle, as non-compliance can result in MOT failure, fines, or your insurance being invalidated.',
  },
  {
    id: 'mod-3',
    question: 'Do I need to inform the DVLA about modifications to my car?',
    answer: 'Yes, certain modifications must be reported to the DVLA. These include significant changes to the vehicle\'s structure, engine, chassis, or body type. You should inform the DVLA if you change the colour of your vehicle, modify the engine capacity or fuel type, or make changes that substantially alter the vehicle\'s appearance or performance characteristics. The DVLA needs to be notified to ensure your vehicle registration document (V5C) accurately reflects the current state of your vehicle. Failure to notify the DVLA about relevant modifications can result in penalties and may affect your insurance validity.',
  },

    id: 'mod-4',
    question: 'How do modifications affect a car\'s resale value?',
    answer: 'Modifications can have varied effects on a car\'s resale value. Quality performance modifications that enhance functionality, when properly documented and maintained, may appeal to enthusiast buyers and preserve or even increase value. However, most modifications typically decrease a vehicle\'s market appeal to general buyers and can reduce resale value. Extreme or poorly executed modifications often diminish value significantly. Tasteful, reversible modifications with receipts and professional installation documentation tend to fare better. When selling a modified car, targeting specialist buyers through enthusiast forums or dealerships like ours that specialise in modified vehicles can help achieve the best possible price.',
  },
  {
    id: 'mod-5',
    question: 'What are the most popular performance modifications?',
    answer: 'The most popular performance modifications include ECU remapping or chip tuning, which optimises the engine\'s electronic control unit for better performance; upgraded exhaust systems that improve exhaust flow and often enhance engine sound; cold air intakes that increase oxygen delivery to the engine; turbochargers or superchargers that boost engine power significantly; suspension upgrades like performance springs, dampers, and anti-roll bars; and brake system enhancements for improved stopping power. These modifications can substantially improve a vehicle\'s acceleration, handling, and overall driving experience, though each comes with considerations regarding legality, warranty implications, and maintenance requirements.',
  },
  {
    id: 'mod-6',
    question: 'Will modifying my car void the manufacturer\'s warranty?',
    answer: 'Modifying your car can potentially void parts of or the entire manufacturer\'s warranty, depending on the modifications and the manufacturer\'s policies. Most warranties include clauses that allow manufacturers to deny claims if failures are caused by aftermarket modifications. Performance modifications such as engine tuning, turbocharging, or suspension alterations are particularly likely to affect warranty coverage. However, manufacturers must prove that a specific modification caused the failure in questionâ€”they cannot void the entire warranty simply because modifications exist. Some modifications may only affect warranty coverage for related components rather than the entire vehicle. Always check your warranty terms and consider manufacturer-approved modifications if warranty coverage is important to you.',
